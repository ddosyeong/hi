    <p>
      Even though we don’t talk much in real life, I’ve come to like you more than I ever thought possible. I accept your imperfections, because you’ve accepted mine. Like you said, who are we to judge when we’re all flawed? I still remember November 29, 2024, when I confessed for the first time. I said it awkwardly, without preparation, but I meant every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      You probably see your kindness as just a friendly gesture, and I understand that. But to me, it felt like something more—though I never let myself assume too much. You told me to try my best, no matter what the results. No one else believed in me like you did. I pressed my wrong buttons, made my mistakes, but you never gave up on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time, I never thought I deserved your attention or your compliments, especially because I’m constantly compared to my sister at home. But for some reason, hearing it from you felt different—it stayed with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      You always tried to be there for me in your own way, and I want you to know that it means the world. Even if I don’t say it often, I appreciate every little thing you do. It’s helped me grow into a better person, even when I didn’t realize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m grateful for the moments we’ve shared, even the quiet ones. Sometimes silence speaks louder than words, and in those moments, I felt a connection with you that I didn’t expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter might be long, but it’s only because there’s so much I want you to know. You’re special to me, and I hope this helps you understand how I feel.
    </p>
