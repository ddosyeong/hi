      <h1>Dear (Ate) Vian,</h1>

      <p>
        I've been keeping this in for a while, but I think today is the perfect time to say it—you’re the reason my days feel brighter.
        Every little moment with you means more than I can put into words. Your smile, your laughter, the way you make everything feel lighter—
        it all makes my heart race in the best way possible. Uhm, I hope you'll read everything I'm about to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, here it is… I like you—a lot. This might not seem like the right timing, but I have something special I want to share with you. 
        Today, the 29th, signifies a new month added to how many months I have liked you in total. Well, today makes it the 9th month. 
        I'm going to be straightforward with this. You being nice, caring, joyful, and loving are the reasons why I've liked you in the first place. 
        Well at first it was because you're pretty. But the more I got to know you, the more my feelings developed. 
        I no longer liked you only from the surface level—but reaching beyond that, making me like you for just being you with everything that comes with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even the “I Like U” by NIKI that you replied to was supposedly meant for you. When you asked who the “U” was, I didn’t mean an initial—I meant you. 
        I’ve never been brave enough to say these things out loud until now. Your simple actions, even a reply, can make my entire day. 
        On my birthday, the best gift I received was your greeting. That moment meant more than you can imagine—it was the day we started chatting again.
      </p>

      <p>
        You've brought warmth into my life in a way I never expected. The little things you do—replying to my messages, remembering small moments—mean the world to me. 
        The poems I sent? They were for you. The songs I posted as my Messenger notes? All for you.
